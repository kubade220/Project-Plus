When selecting devices for testing an iOS application that should work on all Apple phones and tablets, it's essential to consider a combination of factors such as market share, iOS versions, and screen sizes. While the optimal choice may depend on specific project requirements and target audience, a commonly recommended approach is to select devices that represent a significant portion of the user base and cover different screen sizes.

Considering these factors, here are two device recommendations for testing an iOS application:

# iPhone:
* iPhone 12 or iPhone 13: These devices represent the latest iPhone models and are likely to have a significant market share. They also come in different variants (standard, Mini, Pro, Pro Max) that cover various screen sizes, ranging from 5.4 inches to 6.7 inches. Testing on the latest iPhone models ensures compatibility with the latest hardware features and iOS version.
# iPad:
* iPad Air (4th generation): The iPad Air offers a good balance between screen size and market share. It has a 10.9-inch display, which provides a larger screen to test the application's user interface and layout on a tablet form factor. This model is also relatively recent, ensuring compatibility with the latest iOS version.

By choosing the iPhone 12/13 and the iPad Air (4th generation), you cover a range of screen sizes and target the latest hardware and software configurations. However, it's important to consider the specific requirements and demographics of your target users to make the most appropriate device selection for your testing needs.
