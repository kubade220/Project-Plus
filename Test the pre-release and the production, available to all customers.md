# Differences between the apps:
 The development or pre-release app is typically a version of the software that is still being actively developed and tested. It may have new features, bug fixes, or changes that are not yet available in the production app. The store app, on the other hand, is the finalized version that is released to the public. It should be stable and have undergone thorough testing.
# Types of tests:
 Testing of apps can include various types, such as:
* Functional testing: Verifying that the app functions correctly and according to its specifications.
* Regression testing: Ensuring that changes or fixes do not introduce new issues.
* Performance testing: Assessing the app's responsiveness, speed, and resource usage.
* Usability testing: Evaluating how user-friendly the app is and identifying any usability issues.
* Security testing: Checking for vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited.
* Compatibility testing: Testing the app on different devices, operating systems, or platforms.
# Test failures:
 Without specific details about the app or the tests conducted, it is not possible to determine which tests might have failed or why. Test failures can occur due to various reasons, such as coding errors, insufficient test coverage, environmental issues, or unexpected user behavior. It's essential to investigate and analyze the failures to identify the root causes and address them accordingly.
# Not testing on a production application:
 Testing directly on a production application is generally not advisable due to the following reasons:
* Potential impact on users: If there are bugs or issues in the production app, it can lead to a poor user experience, loss of data, or even financial implications.
* Security risks: Testing on a production app may involve exposing sensitive data or features, which can pose security risks.
* Limited control: Testing directly on a live production environment limits the ability to isolate issues, control variables, and perform thorough testing.
#  When to test a production application:
* Testing a production application is advisable under specific circumstances, such as:
* Emergency bug fixes: When critical bugs or security vulnerabilities need immediate resolution, testing on the production app may be necessary to address the issue promptly.
* A/B testing: When you want to evaluate different features or versions of the app with real users to gather feedback and data.
Load testing or performance testing: Assessing the app's performance under realistic user loads can be challenging to replicate in non-production environments.

In general, it's best to conduct thorough testing in development and pre-release environments to catch and address issues before deploying to production.
