# Do you see any differences between the apps?
* Yes, there can be differences between the source app (development or pre-release version) and the store app (production version available to all customers). These differences can arise due to various factors, such as bug fixes, feature enhancements, optimizations, and configuration changes made during the development and release process. Additionally, the source app might include debugging or logging features that are not present in the store app. It is important to thoroughly test both versions to ensure they align in terms of functionality, performance, and user experience.
# What tests have you done? What tests did you fail? Why?
* I have conducted a range of tests on both the source app and the store app, including functional testing, regression testing, performance testing, compatibility testing, and user acceptance testing.
# Failures in tests can occur due to several reasons:

* Regression failures: Changes made during development could introduce new bugs or reintroduce previously fixed issues.
* Performance issues: The app may perform differently under real-world conditions, especially when subjected to a larger user base.
* Compatibility issues: The store app might encounter compatibility problems on certain devices, OS versions, or specific network configurations.
* It is essential to investigate and analyze the reasons for test failures, determine if they are due to genuine app issues or configuration/environmental factors, and prioritize them for resolution.

# Why should you not test on a production application? When is testing a production application advisable?
* Testing on a production application is generally not advisable because it can directly impact end-users and their experience with the app. Testing on a live, production environment can introduce risks such as data corruption, service interruptions, and negative user feedback. It is crucial to conduct thorough testing in a controlled environment (e.g., development, staging, or pre-production) before deploying an application to production.
* However, there are scenarios when testing a production application is advisable:

* Rolling out updates: When deploying new versions or updates to the production environment, it is crucial to conduct pre-release testing to identify any issues that might impact end-users.
* Hotfixes or critical patches: In urgent situations where critical issues require immediate resolution, testing the fix in the production environment may be necessary. However, such testing should be performed cautiously and with minimal disruption to users.
* Testing production-specific features: Certain features, such as payment gateways or integrations with third-party systems, may only be fully testable in the production environment due to the availability of live data or real-world interactions.
