Introduction:
The purpose of this test plan is to outline the testing approach for a Calculator mobile application.
The application is designed to perform basic arithmetic calculations on mobile devices.
The primary goal is to ensure the accuracy, functionality, and usability of the calculator app.
Test Objectives:
Verify the correctness of mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Validate the handling of decimal numbers and negative numbers.
Ensure proper display of results.
Test the responsiveness and usability of the user interface.
Assess the compatibility with different mobile devices and screen resolutions.
Verify the handling of edge cases, such as division by zero and overflow conditions.
Validate memory management and performance of the application.
Test Environment:
Mobile devices: Android and iOS smartphones and tablets.
Operating Systems: Latest versions of Android and iOS.
Screen Resolutions: Various screen resolutions and aspect ratios.
Emulators: Android Emulator, iOS Simulator.
Testing Tools: Test management tool, bug tracking tool, screen capture tool.
Test Scenarios:
4.1. Basic Operations:
Perform addition of two positive numbers.
Perform subtraction of two positive numbers.
Perform multiplication of two positive numbers.
Perform division of two positive numbers.
Repeat the above scenarios with negative numbers.
4.2. Decimal Numbers:
Verify the addition and subtraction of decimal numbers.
Verify the multiplication and division of decimal numbers.
Test the handling of rounding errors.
4.3. Display and User Interface:
Verify the correct display of entered numbers and operations.
Test the responsiveness of the buttons and user input.
Verify the visibility and readability of the calculator screen on different screen resolutions.
4.4. Edge Cases:
Test division by zero and verify the appropriate error message.
Test the maximum and minimum limits of the calculator.
Validate the behavior when exceeding the maximum number of digits.
4.5. Compatibility and Performance:
Test the application on different mobile devices and screen resolutions.
Measure the response time for executing calculations.
Verify the memory usage and assess any potential memory leaks.
Test Execution:
Define test cases for each test scenario mentioned above.
Prioritize the test cases based on risk and criticality.
Execute the test cases on both physical devices and emulators.
Record the test results, including any deviations or defects encountered.
Perform regression testing when defects are fixed or new features are added.
Test Reporting:
Document the test results, including passed and failed test cases.
Report any defects encountered with detailed steps to reproduce.
Include screenshots or videos to illustrate issues if necessary.
Provide recommendations for improvements or enhancements if identified during testing.
Test Schedule and Resources:
Allocate sufficient time for test planning, execution, and reporting.
Determine the number and types of mobile devices to be used for testing.
Assign dedicated resources for test execution, bug tracking, and reporting.
Risks and Mitigation:
Possible risks include device-specific issues, OS compatibility problems, and calculation inaccuracies.
Mitigate risks by using a diverse set of devices for testing, ensuring compatibility with multiple OS versions, and conducting thorough functional and calculation validation.
